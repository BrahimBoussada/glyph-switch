          Everything comes and goes. Empires rise and fall. Cities are built,
          then crumble. The Sumerians pressed their stories into clay, the
          Egyptians reached the heavens with towering pyramids, the Greeks
          defied certainty and pushed the limits of thought, the Romans forged
          laws to hold empires together, and the Mayans traced the patterns of
          the stars. Each contributed in their own way, seeking meaning through
          what they could create.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time moves quietly and without haste. Monuments erode, empires
          transform, and civilizations pass. What lingers is not the structures
          or records themselves, but the intentions behind them, and the care
          with which knowledge, tools, and power were used.
        </p>
        <p>
          True significance grows through curiosity, collaboration, and positive
          impact on others. What we create, how we act, and the ways we support
          others leave echoes that endure beyond any single lifetime or empire.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything is fleeting. What remains is the thoughtfulness behind our
          actions, and the quiet trace of goodness that survives through time.
